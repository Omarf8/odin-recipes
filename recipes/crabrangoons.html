    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crab Rangoon, sometimes called crab puffs, crab rangoon puffs, crab ragoons, cheese wontons, or cream cheese rangoons, are filled crisp dumpling appetizers served primarily in American Chinese restaurants.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 pound crabmeat, shredded</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package small won ton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix cream cheese, crabmeat, soy sauce, ginger, cilantro, parsley, and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet or deep fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cream cheese mixture into the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten the wrapper edges and pull two corners together over filling to make a triangle. Pull two remaining corners up to join them, then press firmly to seal. Repeat to make remaining wontons. Place prepared wontons under a slightly moist paper towel until oil is hot.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry 3 or 4 wontons at a time in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer wontons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve hot.</li>
